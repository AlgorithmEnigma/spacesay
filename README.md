# Spacesay

A python reimagining of cowsay.

Have a astronaut say something, or let it tell you where the ISS is currently!


## Usage

```
pip install spacesay
```

When you first run spacesay it will ask for a username for your Geonames API access, please visit https://www.geonames.org/login to create a username.

Run without options will tell you where the ISS is located.

Run with a string argument to have it echo what you say.
